This WIKI is a basic level html/css/scss website with a splash of javascript. Below is a description of diffrent concepts used to create it.

Design:
In the movie "Spiderman Into the SpiderVerse", several alternate realities collied togather and series of glitches occur.
The indiviual web pages are suppose to represent each spiderman varient's personal universe, (EXP: Spiderman Noir's Universe is black/white as his universe takes place in the 20s)
The header stays the same, among the various webpages "universes", given its somewhat of stranger to all the other elements on each pages. The header has a glitch effect to
simulate multi-dimensonal travel. Adobe colour wheel was used for each page to have complimentary colours. 

Functionality:
1. SCSS, SASS, CSS, HTML, JAVASCPRIPT were used in the creation of the this project. 
2. I used flexbox to make the website accessable to all user's devices (Inlucding Samsung galaxy fold phone). 
3. Prefixes were added so as many browsers as possible could support all of the functionality.
4. For each webpage a music box plays the theme song for each Spiderman.
5. Using SASS organization princples I have UTILS, COMPONENTS and BASE in their own folder with their elements.
6. A carisole showing the comics for each spiderman, with links to amazon and other sites where they can be purchused.
